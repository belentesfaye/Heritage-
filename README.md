Welcome to the Heritage application. This document guides you through setting up and running the frontend portion of the application locally on your machine.

## Getting Started

These instructions assume you have already cloned the Heritage repository from GitHub to your local machine. If you haven't done so, please clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/belentesfaye/Heritage-.git
```


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. This includes npm (Node Package Manager), which is necessary for installing dependencies and running the application. You can download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Running the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `frontend` directory within the cloned Heritage repository:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Heritage-/frontend
   ```

   Ensure you replace `/path/to/Heritage-` with the actual path to the Heritage directory on your machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies. This step needs to be done only once before starting the application for the first time, or whenever you update the dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application:**

   After installing the dependencies, you can start the frontend application by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server. Once the server is running, you can access the application by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
